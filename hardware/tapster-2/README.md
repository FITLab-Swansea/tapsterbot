## Printing the parts

### Notes

`beam-3x1.stl` has incorrect normals when exported from OpenSCAD. This causes prints on a Makerbot to fail in strange ways (e.g. extruder starts printing before reaching target temperature). If you experience this problem, use `stl/beam-3x1-printable.stl` instead, where the normals were fixed using Maya.
